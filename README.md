3. Set the source to your main branch and the root folder.

4. Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/ai-side-hustles/`.

## Form Handling

Since GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side functionality, the contact form currently simulates a submission. For a production site, you have several options:

- Use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) (add your form endpoint to the fetch URL in script.js)
- Use [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) (if deploying through Netlify)
- Create a serverless function with AWS Lambda or similar

To implement Formspree:

1. Sign up for a free Formspree account
2. Create a new form and get your form endpoint
3. Update the fetch URL in script.js with your endpoint

## Customization

- Edit the content in `index.html` to change text
- Modify styles in `styles.css` to change colors, layouts, etc.
- Update functionality in `script.js` as needed
